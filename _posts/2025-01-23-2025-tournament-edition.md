Last year I took Bass Raft on theÂ road in my rookie season fishing some national kayak events. 
It was a blast. I learned a lot, met a ton of great people and introduced Bass Raft to the tournament fishing scene.Â 
This year, I'm hoping to see Bass Raft in more tournaments like this, but not have me be the only one fishing! 
I'm excited to announce the 2025Â Tournament Edition Bass Raft!

The Tournament Edition will be a little bit longer (just over 9 feet in length) for 
additional flotation in the front to support high end trolling motors and electronics. 
It is also a requirement to be at least 9 ft in lengthÂ to be approved for the Bassmaster Kayak Series,
which I'm really hoping will happen this year.

Along with a bit more capacity, the tournament edition is an opinionatedÂ tournament package deal, 
which includes a choice of 36v trolling motor and 10 or 12 inch display integrated with forward facing sonar. 
The current options are to go with a full Garmin setup via the Kraken and EchoMap units or the new 
Lowrance Recon with Lowrance displays. Both of these would have optional 
LiveScope or ActiveTarget sonar. 

More and more tournament anglers are putting their rig on a trailer for faster launch and quicker moves during the day.
The Tournament Edition Bass Raft will also comeÂ with a trailer option! You can go from zero to kayak tournament 
superstar in 3 weeks (current lead time for the Tournament Edition) as there is no other setup quite as awesome as 
the Bass Raft Tournament Edition.

Oh, and one more thing... If you purchase a Bass Raft in 2025 you will get 6 TourneyX entry fees paid for. 
You might feel like the pros, not having to pay the entry fee, lol!

Here's to the 2025 tournament season! ðŸŽ‰
