 I want my Bass Raft customers to be as fanatical 
about Bass Raft as they are about fishing so for the first 10 customers I'm going to do some kinda crazy things.
Become part of the Bass Raft Elite Ten and I gaurentee, you will be glad you did.

Not only does Bass Raft beat any kayak fishing experience out there, it rivals that of a bass boat too.
But I need your help! Who wants to change the kayak fishing world forever?

Bass Raft is a startup company in the “working prototype” phase. Think of it like kickstarter 
except we are trying to connect with anglers that we know are perfect for Bass Raft and Bass Raft is perfect for them.

Be one of our first 10 customers and get loads of perks and benefits that won’t be available for those that come later. 

We are looking for early adopters that want to know the fishing experience can be better than the traditional kayak. 
Or we are looking for those that want a bass boat but can’t afford the boat (and the truck) that does with it.

We are looking for tournament anglers that are serious about the craft of bass fishing. Bass Raft is built for you, 
the fisherman who wouldn’t dream of sitting down to fish, just a bunch of nerves, intensely waiting for that next bite.

Check out the news section of bassraft.com to hear about the adventures and stories of our VIP customers.


Ready to be convinced that Bass Raft beats any fishing experience out there in the solo personal watercraft world?

We have a close knit group of fisherman field testing and the feeback has been amazing! 
I don't know of anyone that would fish from a kayak after fishing from a Bass Raft. 
Be one of the Elite Ten and here's the what'll you'll get:

* Lifetime unconditional warranty. We've built Bass Raft to last, and we stand behind it. We also want to know ways to improve.
* One free upgrade to a future Bass Raft model. We'll do a trade in where we take your old Bass Raft and we give you a new one.
* Free delivery to your door anywhere in the lower 48! We want to meet you in person and make sure you are thrilled.
* Free Bass Raft swag. We have hats, shirts, and stickers that we want to give you.
* For all you content creators out there, let's talk about even more perks!
