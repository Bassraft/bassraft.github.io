What is a Bass Raft VIP Customer? After learing more, you might want to jump out of your kayak into a Bass Raft like this guy.
Seriously AI, what is that? A TV tray and maybe... and ironing board??? But becoming a VIP customer may just make you
feel like this guy, it's going to be that good! Something that makes you want to jump out of your kayak and into a Bass Raft.

We have a close knit group of fisherman field testing and the feeback has been amazing! I don't know of anyone that would fish
from a kayak after fishing from a Bass Raft. Be one of those first customers and here's the what'll you'll get:

* Lifetime unconditional warranty. We've built Bass Raft to last, and we stand behind it. We also want to know ways to improve.
* One free upgrade to a future Bass Raft model. We'll do a trade in where we take your old Bass Raft and we give you a new one.
* Free delivery to your door anywhere in the lower 48! We want to meet you in person and make sure you are thrilled.
* Free Bass Raft swag. We have hats, shirts, and stickers that we want to give you.
* For all you content creators out there, let's talk about even more perks!

You can sign up for the VIP customer experience today on
