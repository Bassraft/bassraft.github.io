Bass Raft is now officially approved to fish in its second national tournament series, the 
[Kayak Adventure Series](https://www.kayakadventureseries.com). 
The KAS is a new tournament series for 2024 started by avid tournament angler
[Drew Gregory](https://www.drewgregory.com) and looks to be a really different type of event. 
And I say event instead of tournament because there is much more than just a fishing tournament going on. 

The inaugural Kayak Adventure Series event (Shoaliepalooza!) has just wrapped up and you can see what 
I mean if you check out the recap 
[here](https://www.kayakadventureseries.com/post/plenty-of-room-in-the-kitchen-a-recap-of-the-inaugural-kayak-adventure-series-event-shoaliepalooza).

Having already committed to fish most of the All American Kayak Series tournaments, 
I don't think I'll get to many of the KAS ones - but now that Bass Raft is approved, 
I'm going to have to. KAS is coming to Wisconsin in the fall so look for Bass Raft to make an appearance!
