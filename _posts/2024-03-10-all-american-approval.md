I'm really excited to announce that Bass Raft is now an approved vessel that can fish 
in the [All American Kayak Series](https://allamericankayakseries.com)! 
This tournament trail focuses on the Midwest, which is perfect for me as a Wisconsin kid.

Bass Raft was designed for tournament fishing as I built the prototype while fishing in a local club. 
The first prototype was built in 2021 and over the last couple years Bass Raft has changed into one of 
the best bass boat style fishing experiences you can get, while still being in the spirit of fishing kayak
 with its light and portable design. Taking it on the road this year into a national tournament series is 
going to be a huge challenge, but I'm so excited to see how Bass Raft handles some of the big water while 
I learn how to fish against some of the best competition in the country.

You can follow along as I'll be posting updates on my social media throughout the summer.
