Bass Raft is hitting the road again this summer for the 2025 tournament season! The first stop is the 
[Great Midwestivus](https://www.kayakadventureseries.com/great-midwestivus) in Springfield Ohio.
This is the 4th tournament of the Kayak Adventure Series (KAS), but the first of the year for me.   
The Kayak Adventure Series puts on a great event - and I say event because it is much more than a fishing tournament.
There is a Bass University seminar on Friday morning with an afternoon "sesh" where the tournament kicks off.
I'll have my Bass Raft around to check out in person and you can even try it out! 


The plan is for me to fish at least 3 KAS events this summer:

Let me know if you plan on being at any of these tournaments, and if you want to trying fishing out of a Bass Raft. 
I can definitely hook you up for a test ride 🏆.
