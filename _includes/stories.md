# How the Raft Was Born

It all started with watching major league fishing one winter and having a blast watching those guys compete. My boys and I started a club with the MLF format of live updates and leaderboard with as many fish as you can catch.

Because it was a catch/weigh/release format, we didn't need livewells and therefore didn't need boats and before you know it we had ourselves a kayak fishing club! But not everyone wanted to fish out of a kayak, so we figured out that we could fish out of anything we wanted, as long as everyone moved around at no wake speeds, just to make things fair.

We picked smaller lakes that other without as much tournament pressure and the first year of the club we grew to about 10 guys. During that first summer of fishing our club, I had the idea of a fishing platform, where I could stand up and fish. There were seveal kayak fishermen in the club, including my boys, but I didn't like sitting in a kayak to fish. It was just too uncomfortable, I couldn't see as well, and it was harder to set the hook. So many drawbacks... but there were some really good points too.

For one, you could go just about anywhere in a kayak. In our first ever tournament for the club, my son took his kayak through a culvert, under the road and fished a little pocket on the other side where the river flowed into the lake. 

That's when my brother Dan and I started talking about building what I was envisioning. Over the course of the summer we learned about composite construction with fiberglass, foam cores, and epoxy to make a really strong and light structure. Dan drafted up some ideas and the first ever bass raft was born.

This first raft was finished in time for the last tournament of the year for our club. It was late August and I was in the running for Angler of the Year, I just needed to win the tournament, or at least finish ahead of my Dad. 

I had the trolling motor setup, pole holders, battery and tackle box velcroed onto the deck and ready for the maiden voyage. It was great! I was up really high, feeling really stable, cruising around as fast as the kayak, and able to get into some tight spots. At the end of the day, I took the raft back into a slew where a boat couldn't go and started catching some bass on frogs in the shallows. The spot actually got deeper again to about 10 feet once you got in a ways, and I was leading the tournament. 

It looked like I might run away with the tournament when I got another blow up on a my frog. With my 7 1/2 heavy flipping stick, I let the bass take it down and then stepped back on the platform and set the hook as hard as I would from the deck of any boat. Simultaneously with the hook set I heard a loud crack, and the next thing I knew I was in the water over my head!

I bobbed back up to the surface, still holding my pole and I see one of my 4 floats had broken off and was floating on it's side by itself with the main raft back level again after it had went vertical sliding me right off into the drink. Amazingly, my tackle box, battery, poles and gear all stayed on the raft because of the velcro and pole holders. I was in some a brushy area, so I put my pole in a busy in 6 feet of water and swam around to get the pieces of the raft. 

After pulling the wreckage over to shore, I went back out into the water to get my fishing pole from the bushes and proceeded to wind up the slack heading back to shore again. Sure enough, the bass on the other end was still there and I felt a little better about things, as there was still another hour left in the tournament and my lead was not comfortable enough yet. I went to weight the bass to get the official score and to my chagrin, the only peiece of equiptment that was missing from the accident was my scale.

Well, the limit was 1 pound and I knew this fish was over a pound. It was pretty close to the pound and 1/2ers I'd been catching (this fish was #8 for the day) but I thought everyone would be ok with me sending it in as 1 lb, after they heard my tale of whao.

My fishing day was pretty much done. I tried to cast from shore a bit, but I think that spot was small enough that the ruckus scared every fish in that little pocket. It was time to call it a day and hope my lead could hold. Right about lines out, I got hold of Dan on the phone and he picked me and the raft up in his boat and helped get us back to the landing.

I had the lead all the way until lines out, but for our club there is a 2 minute grace period for poeple to enter fish into the system, if they actually had the fish landed before lines out. And it so happened that my Dad took advantage of it by catching a keeper right before the end and I got the message a couple minutes after lines out that I had just been surpassed in the leaderboard.

Harley E. 10.57 lbs
Tony E.	  10.32 lbs

If that scale of mine hadn't sunk to the bottom of that 10 foot hole, maybe things would have been different, we'll never know for sure. But one thing was for sure, I had a blast fishing out of the future Bass Raft and there was no way I was going back to anything but rafting or boating. Kayaking was not for me anymore. Even with the catatraphic failure on that hook set, I was ready to go back to the drawing board and figure it out.

# About Us

Bass Raft comes to you via an upstart bunch of Wisconsin fisherman that wanted to build the deck of bass boat experience into the portability of a kayak. There have been many iterations of the design, and many Bass Raft tournaments fished, but now the Bass Raft is finally ready. We wanted to build a super lightweight and stable platform where you forget you are not on the deck of a boat. That's what Bass Raft is.

We wanted to build a super lightweight and stable platform where you forget you are not on the deck of a boat. That's what Bass Raft is.

What started as a Sunday afternoon conversation about composite construction, turned into an obsession to build the best fishing platform the world has ever seen. Being able to stand up and fish is a game changer for portability. When you forget that you are not on the deck of a boat, lightly cruising around a lake, through shallows, quietly creeping up on a dock, you know we've succeeded in our goal.

Stand up and fish.
