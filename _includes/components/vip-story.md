Not many opportunites comes around like this one. I want my Bass Raft customers to be as fanatical 
about Bass Raft as they are about fishing so for the first 10 customers I'm going to do some kinda crazy things.
Become part of the Bass Raft Elite Ten and I gaurentee, you will be glad you did.

Not only does Bass Raft beat any kayak fishing experience out there, it rivals that of a bass boat too.
But I need your help! Who wants to change the kayak fishing world forever?

Bass Raft is a startup company in the “working prototype” phase. Think of it like kickstarter 
except we are trying to connect with anglers that we know are perfect for Bass Raft and Bass Raft is perfect for them.

Be one of our first 10 customers and get loads of perks and benefits that won’t be available for those that come later. 

We are looking for early adopters that want to know the fishing experience can be better than the traditional kayak. 
Or we are looking for those that want a bass boat but can’t afford the boat (and the truck) that does with it.

We are looking for tournament anglers that are serious about the craft of bass fishing. Bass Raft is built for you, 
the fisherman who wouldn’t dream of sitting down to fish, just a bunch of nerves, intensely waiting for that next bite.

Check out the news section of bassraft.com to hear about the adventures and stories of our VIP customers.
