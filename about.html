Bass Raft comes to you via an upstart couple of Wisconsin fisherman with a different vision for kayak fishing.
<!--There have been many iterations of the design and many days on the water, but now the Bass Raft is finally ready. -->
We've built a mashup of bass boat deck and kayak, a super lightweight and stable platform designed
so you can fish all day standing up.
</p>

<p>
What started as a Sunday afternoon conversation about composite construction, turned into an obsession to build the best 
fishing platform the world has ever seen.  If you forget that you are NOT on the deck of a boat, 
lightly cruising around a lake, through shallows, 
quietly creeping up on a dock, you know we've succeeded in our goal.
