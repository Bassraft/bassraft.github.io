Bass Raft comes to you via an upstart bunch of Wisconsin fisherman that wanted to build the deck of bass boat experience into the portability of a kayak. 
There have been many iterations of the design, and many Bass Raft tournaments fished, but now the Bass Raft is finally ready. 
We wanted to build a super lightweight and stable platform where you forget you are not on the deck of a boat. That's what Bass Raft is.

Bass Raft comes to you via an upstart bunch of Wisconsin fisherman had the vision of bass boat meet kayak. 
to build the deck of bass boat experience into the portability of a kayak. There have been many iterations of the design, 
and many Bass Raft tournaments fished, but now the Bass Raft is finally ready. We wanted to build a super lightweight and stable platform where 
you forget you are not on the deck of a boat. That's what Bass Raft is.

What started as a Sunday afternoon conversation about composite construction, turned into an obsession to build the best 
fishing platform the world has ever seen. Being able to stand up and fish is a game changer for portability.
When you forget that you are not on the deck of a boat, lightly cruising around a lake, through shallows, 
quietly creeping up on a dock, you know we've succeeded in our goal.

Stand up and fish.
