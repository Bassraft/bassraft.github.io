- question: Where is the seat?
  answer: There isn't one. Bass Raft fishes like the deck of most bass boats where stand up fishing is the norm.
    A hard case tackle box or cooler can be a good substitute for a chair for the times you might want to sit down.

- question: How much does it weigh?
  answer: Depending on the model, somewhere between 40 and 70 lbs. Shocked? 
    Yes, it is an amazingly light weight craft that can be car topped or put in the back of a truck with ease.

- question: Can it be paddled?
  answer: For sure! It paddles like a stand up paddleboard. While Bass Raft totally embraces the trolling motor aspect of fishing, 
    it is sold as a paddle craft and you can expect it to perform as such. 
    Oh, and each Bass Raft comes with a custom designed "Spike Paddle" which doubles as a shallow water anchor. It's pretty cool.

- question: How well does it work with forward facing sonar?
  answer: So glad you asked! There is no other fishing kayak on the market that can compare to Bass Raft when it comes to FFS. 
    With a foot pedal trolling motor (highly recommended), the stand up, hands free fishing experience is how we roll. 
    This side of a bass boat, there is nothing like a Bass Raft for FFS.

- question: How much weight can it hold?
  answer: Depending on the model, the capacity is anywhere from 400 to 600 pounds. 
    Either way, it'll support the kind of fishing you want to do whether it's fly fishing, bass fishing, bow fishing,
    tournament fishing, or fun fishing. Go light or fill it up with gear, electronics, trolling motors and batteries.
    It's all good.

- question: How fast does it go?
  answer: Well that depends on how fast you want to go.
    With an electric motor it will go about the same speed as most fishing kayaks. We clocked the Bass Raft OG at
    6.3 mph with the Garmin Kraken 36v trolling motor. Paddling speed is on par with stand up paddleboards.

- question: Are they for sale, and how can I get one?
  answer: Yes! To buy one, you just need to get in touch and we'll get the process rolling. Each Bass Raft is custom built for you with lots 
    of options. Email us, call us, or use the contact form below.
